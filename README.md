Boris Bike V3
=============

This was my third and final iteration of boris bikes this time implemented using test doubles.

Week two project at the makers academy introduced us to OOP and testing with rspec.
The task was to model the "Boris Bikes" bike hire system. After a day of building a domian model. 
I formed a pair and Implemented out domain model. And we even managed to squeeze in a tiny bit of meta programming.
